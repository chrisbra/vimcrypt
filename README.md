# A small project to play around with libsodium

## The idea

Learn something about [libsodium][1], which is now also part of Vim (see [patch 8.2.3022][2]). 

So here is a small utility, that let's you encrypt and decrypt messages, that can also be read by Vim.

You can use the old and new Vim cryptmethod:
- cryptmethod: 'xchacha20'   - cryptmethod 'xchacha20', requires vim 8.2.3022
- cryptmethod: 'xchacha20v2' - new cryptmethod, requires [Vim v9.0.1481][3]

### Install

```sh
~$ apt install libsodium-dev # libsodium is required to build
~$ git clone https://github.com/chrisbra/vimcrypt
~$ cd vimcrypt; make
```

### Different Xchacha20 Versions

The difference between the [new xchacha20v2][3] and the [old xchacha20][2] is basically, that the new method also stores the parameters
required for correct key-derivation:

    - opslimit: the maximum amount of computations to perform. By default, this is OPSLIMIT_INTERACTIVE.
    - memlimit: the amount of memory you want to reserve for password hashing. By default, this is MEMLIMIT_INTERACTIVE
    - alg:      the algorithm used for the key derivation. By default, this is '2' (ARGON2ID13)

### Usage

```sh
~$ vimcrypt encrypt file  # encrypt
~$ vimcrypt decrypt file.enc # decrypt
```

By default, when encrypting, it will leave your precious input files alone and write the encrypted file to the same name with the suffix `.enc` added.

That means, you need to decrypt files with the name `<input>.enc`.

#### Arguments:

```
-v        -  be verbose
-b <nr>   -  Use <nr> as block size for encryption
-V 1      -  Use xchacha20 (old) libsodium version
-V 2      -  Use xchacha20v2 libsodium vim version
```

This matters mostly for files larger than the block size, because if the wrong block size is given, the file won't be decrypted properly.
By default, Vim uses a block size of 8192 Bytes, so this script also uses 8K block size if no one is given.
